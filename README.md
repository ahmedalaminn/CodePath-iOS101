ColorToggler is an app that allows users to change the background color by tapping a button

Time spent: 2 hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users see a screen with three labels and a button  
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color  

## App Brainstorming
Favorite apps and their features:
Instagram: posting pictures, messaging friends, ig reels
EverydayMuslim: log when I pray, see prayer times, read Quran
YouTube: watch videos, comment on videos, post my own videos

### My App Idea
Productivity app to help students studying. 
You often hear of useful studying techniques such as pomodoro and active recall. 
I think having an app to implement and streamline how to study would be really usefull, especially if I can get some AI involved. 

## Notes
Finding all the buttons was tough. Need to learn the editor and gain muscle memory.
